        <p class="hidden text" id="Programming">
          Ever since I was young I've had a fascination with computers. Programming seems to have become my outlet for this fascination. All of my programming skill is self-taught, with help from examples on the internet. When I was 10 I created my first website. I kept updating it and adding to it, with lots of help from the internet, for a little more than a year. You can still see an archived version of it <a href="old/index.html" style = "color: white;">here</a>, complete with broken plugins and misspelt words. Now, 7 years later, I mainly play around with programming in Python, Java, Processing, and HTML as my go-to hobby. I have created a handful of Android applications, some Amazon Alexa skills, a Twitter bot, numerous 3D music visualizers, and countless (like, literally hundereds of) tiny side-projects. Programming is definitely one of my biggest, if not the biggest, passions.

        <p class="hidden text" id="Science">
          Science has always been my favorite subject in school, other than perhaps math. It has always intrigued me to learn how the world works and why it works that way. I've always strived to take high-level science courses in high school, from Honors Freshmen Science to AP Physics. I hope to one day be able to provide knowledge so that others can learn more about how the world works.

        <p class="hidden text" id="Math">
          Math is one of my biggest passions. Examining the way that numbers interact and work together is always so interesting to me, especially as the interactions between them get more and more complex. The way that math expands on itself is unparalleled to any other subject or science, in my opinion. Taking advanced math courses, such as AP Calculus, really made this theme stand out to me and made me more interested in math itself.

        <p class="hidden text" id="Pokémon">
          Where to start... I've loved Pokémon since I was 8 years old. Ever since I played my first Pokémon game, <i>Pokémon Ruby Version</i>, almost a decade ago, I don't think I've put the games down. I enjoy everything about them, from the EVs to the IVs to the Eevees. In particular, my favorite Pokémon is <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Magikarp_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" style="color:white">Magikarp</a>, although I'm not sure why. For the past few years I've been a veteran to the Pokémon Club at my high school, where we play competitively. The amount of logic involved in competitive play of the games is a suprisingly large amount, and I believe that's what has kept me interested throughout all these years.

        <p class="hidden text" id="DoctorspaceWho">
          Doctor Who is by far my favorite television show. All of the wacky adventures and their mind-blowing conclusions always have my curiosity peaked. I first learned about <i>Doctor Who</i> in the seventh grade, when some of my friends were beginning to show interest in the series. My favorite actor to have played "The Doctor" is David Tennant, who played the tenth iteration of the character; I even got his autograph when I was in ninth grade.

        <p class="hidden text" id="RetrospaceGaming">
          I love old video games. From <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> for the Nintendo Entertainment System to <i>Kangaroo</i> for the Atari 2600, it's safe to say I've played a lot of retro video games. I particurally enjoy watching people play these games online, competing for the fastest times and highest scores. My favorite video game to watch is <i>Super Mario World</i> for SNES, which I actually own along with my very own SNES that I bought at a thrift store for four dollars!
